# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on the detection of credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate models that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions and help in minimizing financial losses.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes information about credit card transactions, with features such as transaction details, user information, and labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Ensure that you have the dataset downloaded or linked correctly before running the code.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

- **Data:** Folder containing the dataset. Make sure to include sample data or instructions on how to obtain the dataset.

- **Results:** Folder to store any output files or visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Project Overview

Credit Card Fraud Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying and preventing fraudulent credit card transactions. The project leverages various algorithms and techniques to analyze transaction data, detect patterns indicative of fraud, and build models capable of flagging potentially fraudulent activities.

### Objectives

1. **Minimize Financial Losses:** The primary goal is to minimize financial losses caused by credit card fraud. By accurately identifying and blocking fraudulent transactions, financial institutions can protect both themselves and their customers.

2. **Improve Security:** Enhance the overall security of credit card transactions, instilling confidence in users and fostering trust in the financial system.

3. **Utilize Machine Learning:** Employ machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, SVM, and naive Bayes, to create effective models for fraud detection.

4. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset. Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Utilize various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, to assess the performance of the machine learning models. Optimize the models to achieve the best possible balance between precision and recall.
